# Module5-WorkDaySchedular

## Description
 Create a calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. 
	

## Usage
The daily planner will be for the given day with the timeblocks for the standered business hours. Each time block will be color codded to indicated if the time is in the past, present or future. When I add text to the timeblock I can use the save button for that timeblock and it is saved in local storage. If the page is reset the text in timeblock is still saved.
If click the clear button all information in timblock is cleared
